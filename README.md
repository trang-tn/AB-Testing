# AB-Testing

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. 

For this project, I analyzed the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The analysis can help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

Please refer to `Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.ipynb` for full code.
